# Objectives

The PEC Alliance aims to transform renewable energy procurement and carbon accounting by achieving these objectives:

1. **Develop and Maintain the PEC Standard**
   1. Develop a robust methodology combining hourly Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) with marginal avoided emissions to quantify the carbon impact of energy entering the grid accurately.
2. **Operate the PEC Registry with Integrity and Transparency**
   1. Maintain a transparent, accountable registry governed by PECA and regularly update the PEC Standard to reflect technological and regulatory changes.
3. **Establish Global Emissions Data Selection Process**
   1. Develop a global method for selecting emissions data providers and factors for consistent carbon impact assessment.
4. **Publish the Emissions Matching Standard**
   1. Provide guidelines for using the avoided emissions of PECs to accurately match energy buyers' induced emissions to support sustainability goals and accurate impact-based reporting.
5. **Align with Industry Standards**
   1. Ensure PEC standards align with the EnergyTag Standard and the GHG Protocol to enhance adoption.
6. **Promote Education and Awareness**
   1. Increase awareness and provide educational resources on PEC benefits among stakeholders.
7. **Foster Collaboration and Innovation**
   1. Encourage industry collaboration to drive innovation in carbon accounting and emissions reduction.
   2. Facilitate knowledge sharing through working groups, webinars, and industry events.
8. **Facilitate Regulatory Acceptance**
   1. Align the PEC methodology with international standards and regulatory frameworks for global adoption.
9. **Promote Stakeholder Engagement**
   1. Engage diverse stakeholders in the methodology development process, including technology developers, regulatory agencies, clean energy buyers, and environmental groups.
