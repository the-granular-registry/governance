# Standards and Methodologies

The PEC Alliance (PECA) is dedicated to continuously developing and rigorously maintaining two key standards: the PEC Standard and the Emissions-Matching Standard. These standards are designed to provide a robust framework for issuing and using Power Emissions Certificates (PECs), ensuring transparency, accuracy, and reliability in carbon accounting and emissions reduction efforts.

## Emissions Data Selection Hierarchy <a href="#toc170118004" id="toc170118004"></a>

Both the PEC Standard and the Emissions-Matching Standard will rely on a robust emissions data hierarchy. This hierarchy determines the appropriate source of marginal emissions data for each region based on temporal and spatial resolution, ensuring the most accurate and relevant data is used for carbon accounting.

* **Temporal Resolution:** To capture the dynamic nature of grid emissions and renewable energy generation, emissions data with the highest temporal resolution (e.g., hourly data) will be preferred.
* **Spatial Resolution:** Emissions data with higher spatial resolution (e.g., nodal or regional data) will be prioritized to reflect the geographical variability in grid emissions accurately.
* **Data Sources:** The hierarchy will outline a preference order for data sources, including but not limited to real-time grid emissions data, historical emissions data, and modeled emissions data.

* **Purpose:** The PEC Standard establishes the criteria and procedures for issuing Power Emissions Certificates. It ensures that PECs accurately represent the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation and storage activities.
* **Development Process:** This standard is developed through a collaborative process involving industry experts, stakeholders, and regulatory bodies. It undergoes periodic reviews to incorporate advancements in technology, changes in regulatory requirements, and stakeholder feedback.
* **Maintenance:** An advisory board will oversee the maintenance of the PEC Standard, ensuring it remains up-to-date and reflects best practices in carbon accounting and renewable energy verification.

## Emissions-Matching Standard <a href="#toc170118002" id="toc170118002"></a>

* **Purpose:** The Emissions-Matching Standard provides a methodology for energy users to assess induced emissions and utilize PECs for comprehensive carbon accounting. This standard facilitates accurate tracking of emissions reductions by aligning energy consumption with renewable energy generation.
* **Development Process:** Similar to the PEC Standard, the Emissions-Matching Standard is developed through stakeholder collaboration, incorporating input from industry leaders, environmental organizations, and regulatory bodies. It is regularly updated to align with the latest emissions data and carbon accounting methodologies.
* **Maintenance:** A dedicated committee within the PECA will be responsible for maintaining the Standard on an ongoing basis, ensuring it adapts to evolving carbon accounting needs and regulatory landscapes.
