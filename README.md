# Introduction

## Purpose of the Charter <a href="#toc170117996" id="toc170117996"></a>

The Power Emissions Certificate Alliance (PECA) Charter aims to establish a comprehensive framework for the creation, implementation, and governance of Power Emissions Certificates (PECs). This charter outlines the objectives, standards, methodologies, and governance structures that underpin the PECAâ€™s mission.

## Background and Context <a href="#toc170117997" id="toc170117997"></a>

As the world focuses on fighting climate change, there is a growing need for more precise methods to measure and reduce carbon emissions. PECs offer a more accurate way to quantify the environmental impact of renewable energy, encouraging its adoption in areas where it can achieve the greatest emissions reductions.

## Mission Statement <a href="#toc170117998" id="toc170117998"></a>

The PEC Alliance (PECA) is committed to advancing global decarbonization efforts by establishing and promoting the Power Emissions Certificate (PEC) Standard. Our mission is to provide a transparent, accurate, and standardized framework for quantifying and verifying the carbon impact of energy generation and storage. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to empower energy buyers with the tools necessary to achieve meaningful and verifiable emissions reductions.
