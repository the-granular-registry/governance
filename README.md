## Purpose of the Charter <a href="#toc170117996" id="toc170117996"></a>

The Granular Registry Advisory Board Charter aims to establish a comprehensive framework for the creation, implementation, and governance of Granular Certificates (GCs). This charter outlines the objectives, standards, methodologies, and governance structures that underpin the mission.

## Background and Context <a href="#toc170117997" id="toc170117997"></a>

As the world focuses on fighting climate change, there is a growing need for more precise methods to measure and reduce carbon emissions. GCs offer a more accurate way to quantify the environmental impact of renewable energy, encouraging its adoption in areas where it can achieve the greatest emissions reductions.

## Mission Statement <a href="#toc170117998" id="toc170117998"></a>

The Granular Registry Advisory Board is committed to advancing global decarbonization efforts by promoting the evolving granular standards. Our mission is to provide a transparent, accurate, and standardized framework for quantifying and verifying the carbon impact of energy generation and storage. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to empower energy buyers with the tools necessary to achieve meaningful and verifiable emissions reductions.
